# Pitch #3 — Premium Brand Refresh + Storytelling

## Concept

Remake **Mine Performance Academy** into a **premium, story-driven brand site** that feels like a top-tier training facility. The refresh prioritizes **brand credibility**, **coaching expertise**, **rehab confidence**, and **facility quality** so the academy can command trust and support stronger pricing.

## Why this drives trust and pricing power

1. **Narrative over noise**  
   The current StatStak shell is minimal: a few nav items and links. There’s no story. By introducing clear modules—**The Problem** (athletes plateau, risk injury, lack a plan), **The Method** (assess → plan → train → measure), **The Proof** (results, testimonials), **The Place** (facility + tech)—we give parents, athletes, and referrers a reason to believe. Trust comes from “this is how we work,” not “we’re great.”

2. **Credibility in the right order**  
   Leading with **evidence-based training**, **individualized development**, and **rehab & longevity** positions the academy as serious and responsible. A dedicated **Rehab & Return-to-Throw** page with careful, non-promissory copy builds confidence without overclaiming. **Meet the Coaches** with consistent bios and credentials turns faces into authority.

3. **Facility as proof**  
   “The Place” isn’t filler—it’s proof. A dedicated facility page (and imagery across the site) shows investment in environment and tech. That supports both trust (“they’re legit”) and willingness to pay (“this is a premium experience”).

4. **Consistent premium execution**  
   Typography scale, spacing, and motion are tuned to feel **editorial + cinematic sports**, not template-y. Sticky mobile CTAs (“Book an Evaluation”, “View Programs”) keep next steps obvious. Together, the experience feels intentional and premium, which underpins pricing power.

## What we’re delivering

- **Brand platform** (`/docs/brand-platform.md`): positioning, pillars, voice, messaging hierarchy, visual direction.
- **Full site experience**: cinematic hero, story modules, method page, programs, coaches, facility, results (including leaderboard highlights), events (deep link to StatStak), rehab (responsible copy), contact.
- **Technical**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn-style components, Framer Motion (tight and performant), SEO (metadata, OG, sitemap, LocalBusiness schema), accessibility basics.
- **Content**: Centralized copy in `/content/site-copy.ts`; trainer placeholders and launch checklist for client-supplied content.

This narrative-led, premium execution is the creative and UX foundation for trust and pricing power.
