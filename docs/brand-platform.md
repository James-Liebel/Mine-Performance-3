# Mine Performance Academy — Brand Platform

## Brand positioning statement

## Brand pillars

1. **Evidence-Based Training** — Every program is grounded in assessment data and proven progressions, not guesswork.
2. **Individualized Development** — One-size-fits-all doesn’t work. We build plans around the athlete, not the other way around.
3. **Rehab & Longevity** — Safe return-to-throw and return-to-sport protocols that protect the athlete’s long-term ceiling.
4. **Competitive Edge** — The facility, tech, and coaching expertise that separate “good” from “elite.”
5. **Community** — A culture of accountability, events, and shared standards (e.g. leaderboards, milestones).

## Voice and tone

- **Direct** — Short sentences. No filler. Say what we do and why it matters.
- **Confident** — We don’t hedge. We state capabilities and outcomes without hype.
- **Coach-like** — Clear, instructive, supportive. We guide; we don’t lecture.
- **No fluff** — No generic “we’re passionate” or vague promises. Specifics over slogans.

## Visual direction

### Typography

- **Primary (headings):** Strong, editorial serif or geometric sans (e.g. **Instrument Serif** or **Syne**) for hero and section titles. Scale: clear hierarchy (e.g. 3–4 sizes).
- **Secondary (body):** Highly readable sans (e.g. **DM Sans** or **Inter**) for body and UI. Comfortable line length and line height.
- **Pairing rule:** One distinct voice for headlines, one neutral for reading. Avoid more than two type families.

### Spacing

- Generous whitespace. Sections breathe; no cramming. Use a consistent spacing scale (e.g. 8px base: 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128).
- Clear separation between “story” modules (Problem, Method, Proof, Place).

### Imagery

- Real facility, real athletes, real coaches. No stock “gym bro” clichés if avoidable.
- Prefer high contrast, sharp focus. Cinematic crops for hero; detail shots for facility/tech.
- Color grade: confident, not washed out. Deep blacks and clear highlights.

### Motion

- **Subtle and performance-friendly.** No heavy parallax or long animations that block content.
- Use: short fade/slide on scroll (e.g. 300–500ms), gentle hover states, optional light scale on CTAs.
- Prefer `transform` and `opacity`; avoid layout thrash. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
