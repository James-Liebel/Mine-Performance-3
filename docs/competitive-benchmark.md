## 2. Deep dive: 5 best-in-class references

### 2.1 Pittsburgh Baseball Lab

- **IA:** Home → About, What We Offer (Hitting, Pitching, Strength & Conditioning), App, Products, News. Clear one-level nav.
- **CTA:** “READ MORE” (about), “DOWNLOAD OUR APP,” “CHECK OUT THE CATALOG.” No single “Book an evaluation” but clear next steps.
- **Program discovery:** “What We Offer” with four pillars (Elite Instruction, Hitting, Pitching, S&C); each has a short descriptor and tech (HitTrax, Trackman, Powerlift, EliteForm, Proteus, Hawkin).
- **Coach bios:** Home stresses “former and current professional players” and “don’t guess — they’ve lived it”; no individual bios on fetched snippet.
- **Trust:** Pro-player credibility, data-driven language, equipment list, “intentional mentorship” and “clear path forward.”
- **Results:** Not prominent on home; “complete players, on and off the field.”

### 2.2 Cressey Sports Performance (CSP)

- **IA:** Brand-forward; minimal content in fetch (CSP name).
- **Pattern:** Strong brand name as anchor; likely programs/coaches deeper in site.

### 2.3 RPP Revolution / RPP Baseball

- **IA:** “The Revolution is Coming” — why RPP is doing travel; tech stack; testimonials; “Interested?” → player development; “Upcoming Tryouts.”
- **CTA:** “Click here” to player development; tryouts as event CTA.
- **Program discovery:** Described by outcome (weight room, skills, recruiting, nutrition, speed, throwing/hitting, mental, data) rather than program names.
- **Coach/trust:** Testimonials with names and titles (Drew Dickinson – UVA; Corey Muscara – Wake Forest); “world class,” “cutting edge,” “leading edge.”
- **Results:** “Results speak for themselves”; “best up-and-coming talent”; facility framed as “not nets hung from the ceiling” but advanced program.

### 2.4 Driveline Baseball

- **IA:** Research/data brand; “Research Lab” signals science and tech.
- **Pattern:** Motion capture, force plates, ball tracking; positions as R&D leader. Good for “evidence-based” positioning.

### 2.5 Pitching Performance Lab (PPL)

- **IA:** Process-led: movement screening → assessment bullpen (Edgertronic, Trackman) → personalized coaching.
- **CTA:** “Unlimited facility access” + individualized programs.
- **Trust:** Clear process (screen → assess → coach); tech names (Edgertronic, Trackman) as proof.
