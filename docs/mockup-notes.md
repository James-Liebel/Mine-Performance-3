# Mockup notes — Mine-Performance-3 (Cinematic premium)

## What this theme communicates

- **Premium and editorial:** Dark palette, bold typography, generous spacing. Feels like a high-end brand story, not a generic landing page.
- **Storytelling:** Problem → Method → Proof → Place. Coaches and results are presented as “proof” with context; sections breathe.
- **Confident and focused:** Strong contrast, minimal decoration, tasteful motion on links. Athletes and premium buyers feel the quality.

## Who it appeals to

- **Athletes and families** who care about program quality and results over a “salesy” feel.
- **Premium buyers** who respond to craft and narrative over bright CTAs.
- **Stakeholders** who want a second, more “cinematic” mockup to compare with the conversion-first (MP1) and source (MP2) designs.

## Pages to demo first (and why)

1. **Home** — Story sections (Problem, Proof, etc.), typography scale, and spacing. Best first impression of the cinematic theme.
2. **Results** — Leaderboards and “proof” content; how data is presented with editorial context.
3. **Coaches** — Coaches as proof; premium card layout and spacing.
4. **About** — Narrative and brand voice with the darker, editorial look.

## Brand

- Same “Mine Performance” baseball academy brand as MP2 and MP1; only the **presentation** (cinematic premium) differs.
